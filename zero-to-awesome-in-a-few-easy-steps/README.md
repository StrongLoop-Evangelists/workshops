Zero to Awesome: API-driven Apps in a Few Easy Steps
---

We all have a million ideas that may either scratch a particular itch or be the “next Pokemon Go.” Lets see how we can use an API-driven approach to take our idea from nothing to amazing. With the power of LoopBack, you can create an API layer in moments, but its how you make it awesome that counts.

**Note:** This is essentially an overview and walkthrough of LoopBack. Use the Getting Started tutorials in the docs to drive this workshop. It works great!
